Smart Mirror
========================

The Smart Mirror is your family's DYI morning buddy. It helps you start up your days by showing the info that's important to you... while you brush your teeth! Did we mention it also helps you stay in shape? 

See your weight. 

See your weight history as a graph. 

See your calendar. 

Meet your colleagues at work with a funny quote your mirror told you this morning!

Have a good laugh with the day's [best GIF](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2014-07/18/8/enhanced/webdr04/anigif_enhanced-buzz-21129-1405685676-5.gif).

###But how does the mirror know who is using it?
That's the fun part! You can log in seamlessly: just hop on the board and your profile will load*. First time using the mirror? You just need a smartphone for two minutes to let the mirror know who you are. You scan a QR code which will load your profile page. Just tell the mirror your name and you're good to go.

\*We use the board to identify body data for each user. Combine it with the mirror's data and that's your login. We call it ***1-Step-Authentication***: you step on the board and you're in.

We hope you'll have as much fun using the mirror [as we had developing it](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2014-07/18/11/enhanced/webdr08/anigif_enhanced-buzz-9623-1405698176-4.gif)

###Talk tech to me, baby
Uhm, ok. Here are the repos:

App: [https://github.com/Konkrad/smartmirror](https://github.com/Konkrad/smartmirror)

Backend: [https://github.com/viorelsfetea/SmartMirror](https://github.com/viorelsfetea/SmartMirror)

*This proof of concept has been built using a Wii FitBoard, a Samsung Galaxy Nexus that runs a Cordova app and a DYI mirror-kit. Building the mirror was the hardest part.*
